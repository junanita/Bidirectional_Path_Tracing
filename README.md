# CG-asst5
There are two parts that I’m pretty interested in after these four assignments:
Advanced Monte Carlo Rendering
Mesh-Based Dynamics


Even though my asst 3 is not perfect, I’m still dreaming of implementing some advanced algorithm to enhance the ray tracing rendering performance.

1. So my first choice for assignment 5 is implementing Bidirectional Path Tracing. I’m expecting this algorithm can handle indirect lighting problems far more efficiently and robustly than ordinary path tracing.


2. If I can implement the first part smoothly, I still want to work on Photon Mapping for extra credit, which will definitely give me better result(it should make cornel box like a real one).

3. Since I’m also interested in the bunny that Prof. Keenan shown on lecture, I may use late days to implement basic linear equations: Laplace, heat, and wave equations on mesh.
