# CG-asst5
There are two parts that I’m pretty interested in after these four assignments:
- Advanced Monte Carlo Rendering
- Mesh-Based Dynamics


Even though my asst 3 is not perfect, I’m still dreaming of implementing some advanced algorithm to enhance the ray tracing rendering performance.

1. So my first choice for assignment 5 is implementing <strong> Bidirectional Path Tracing </strong>. I’m expecting this algorithm can handle indirect lighting problems far more efficiently and robustly than ordinary path tracing.


2. Since I’m also interested in the bunny that Prof. Keenan shown on lecture, I still want to work on implementing basic linear equations: Laplace, heat, and wave equations on mesh. I'm also considering this part as an extra credit.


3. If I can implement the first two parts smoothly, I may use ‘late’ days to implement Photon Mapping for extra credit, which will definitely give me better result(it should make cornel box like a real one). But not
